# Search-Engine

To build the search engine, follow the steps:
* Clone this repository, or Download all the files by pressing the green-colored "code" button.
* If you have cloned the repository, move on to the next step. If you have downloaded the zip file, then extract it in a folder.
* Open the folder containing these files.
* All the text files which will be used by the search engine(e.g. TFIDF.txt, IDF.txt, magnitude.txt etc.), are already built and present along with all other files. Also, one can build these files by running command ```node build_txt_files.js``` in the terminal.
* Run ```npm i``` to download all the required npm packages.
* Once the text files are ready, run ```node index.js``` to build and start the local server. Once started, open http://localhost:3000/ in a browser.
* You can now use the search engine to practice a variety of DSA questions of your choice.
