 CSES - Tree Traversals      There are three common ways to traverse the nodes of a binary tree:  Preorder: First process the root, then the left subtree, and finally the right subtree. Inorder: First process the left subtree, then the root, and finally the right subtree. Postorder: First process the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally the root.  There is a binary tree of nn nodes with distinct labels. You are given the preorder and inorder traversals of the tree, and your task is to determine its postorder traversal.
