You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of length n.The average difference of the index i is the absolute difference between the average of the first i + 1 elements of nums and the average of the last n - i - 1 elements. Both averages should be rounded down to the nearest integer.Return the index with the minimum average difference. If there are multiple such indices, return the smallest one.Note:Â
