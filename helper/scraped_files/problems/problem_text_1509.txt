You are given an array arr of positive integers. You are also given the array queries where queries[i] = [lefti, righti].For each query i compute the XOR of elements from lefti to righti (that is, arr[lefti] XOR arr[lefti + 1] XOR ... XOR arr[righti] ).Return an array answer where answer[i] is the answer to the ith query.Â
