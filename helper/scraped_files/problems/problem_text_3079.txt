 CSES - Planets Cycles      You are playing a game consisting of nn planets. Each planet has a teleporter to another planet (or the planet itself).  You start on a planet and then travel through teleporters until you reach a planet that you have already visited before.  Your task is to calculate for each planet the number of teleportations there would be if you started on that planet.
