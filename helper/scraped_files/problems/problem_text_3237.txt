 CSES - String Transform      Consider the following string transformation:   append the character # to the string (we assume that # is lexicographically smaller than all other characters of the string)  generate all rotations of the string  sort the rotations in increasing order  based on this order, construct a new string that contains the last character of each rotation  For example, the string babc becomes babc#. Then, the sorted list of rotations is #babc, abc#b, babc#, bc#ba, and c#bab. This yields a string cb#ab.
