 CSES - Grid Paths      There are 8841888418 paths in a 7×77×7 grid from the upper-left square to the lower-left square. Each path corresponds to a 4848-character description consisting of characters D (down), U (up), L (left) and R (right).  For example, the path  corresponds to the description DRURRRRRDDDLUULDDDLDRRURDDLLLLLURULURRUULDLLDDDD.  You are given a description of a path which may also contain characters ? (any direction). Your task is to calculate the number of paths that match the description.
