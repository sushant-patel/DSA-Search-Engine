Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.There are n stones arranged in a row. On each player's turn, while the number of stones is more than one, they will do the following:The game stops when only one stone is left in the row.The score difference between Alice and Bob is (Alice's score - Bob's score). Alice's goal is to maximize the score difference, and Bob's goal is the minimize the score difference.Given an integer array stones of length n where stones[i] represents the value of the ith stone from the left, return the score difference between Alice and Bob if they both play optimally.Â
