You are given a 0-indexed array of n integers differences, which describes the differences between each pair of consecutive integers of a hidden sequence of length (n + 1). More formally, call the hidden sequence hidden, then we have that differences[i] = hidden[i + 1] - hidden[i].You are further given two integers lower and upper that describe the inclusive range of values [lower, upper] that the hidden sequence can contain.Return the number of possible hidden sequences there are. If there are no possible sequences, return 0.Â
