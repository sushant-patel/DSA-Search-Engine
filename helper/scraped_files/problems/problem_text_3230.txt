 CSES - Stack Weights      You have nn coins, each of which has a distinct weight.  There are two stacks which are initially empty. On each step you move one coin to a stack. You never remove a coin from a stack.  After each move, your task is to determine which stack is heavier (if we can be sure that either stack is heavier).
