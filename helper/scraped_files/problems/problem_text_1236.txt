Given an m x n grid. Each cell of the grid has a sign pointing to the next cell you should visit if you are currently in this cell. The sign of grid[i][j] can be:Notice that there could be some signs on the cells of the grid that point outside the grid.You will initially start at the upper left cell (0, 0). A valid path in the grid is a path that starts from the upper left cell (0, 0) and ends at the bottom-right cell (m - 1, n - 1) following the signs on the grid. The valid path does not have to be the shortest.You can modify the sign on a cell with cost = 1. You can modify the sign on a cell one time only.Return the minimum cost to make the grid have at least one valid path.Â
