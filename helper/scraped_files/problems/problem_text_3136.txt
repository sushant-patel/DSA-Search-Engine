 CSES - Divisor Analysis      Given an integer, your task is to find the number, sum and product of its divisors. As an example, let us consider the number 1212:  the number of divisors is 66 (they are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12)  the sum of divisors is 1+2+3+4+6+12=28  the product of divisors is 1⋅2⋅3⋅4⋅6⋅12=1728  Since the input number may be large, it is given as a prime factorization.
