 CSES - Monsters      You and some monsters are in a labyrinth. When taking a step to some direction in the labyrinth, each monster may simultaneously take one as well. Your goal is to reach one of the boundary squares without ever sharing a square with a monster.  Your task is to find out if your goal is possible, and if it is, print a path that you can follow. Your plan has to work in any situation; even if the monsters know your path beforehand.
