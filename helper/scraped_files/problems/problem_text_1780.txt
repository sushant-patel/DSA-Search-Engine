If it rains over a lake that is full of water, there will be a flood. Your goal is to avoid floods in any lake.Given an integer array rains where:Return an array ans where:If there are multiple valid answers return any of them. If it is impossible to avoid flood return an empty array.Notice that if you chose to dry a full lake, it becomes empty, but if you chose to dry an empty lake, nothing changes.Â
