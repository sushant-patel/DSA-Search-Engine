(This problem is an interactive problem.)You may recall that an array arr is a mountain array if and only if:Given a mountain array mountainArr, return the minimum index such that mountainArr.get(index) == target. If such an index does not exist, return -1.You cannot access the mountain array directly. You may only access the array using a MountainArray interface:Submissions making more than 100 calls to MountainArray.get will be judged Wrong Answer. Also, any solutions that attempt to circumvent the judge will result in disqualification.Â
