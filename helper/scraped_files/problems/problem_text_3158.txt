 CSES - Stair Game      There is a staircase consisting of nn stairs, numbered 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n. Initially, each stair has some number of balls.  There are two players who move alternately. On each move, a player chooses a stair k where k≠1 and it has at least one ball. Then, the player moves any number of balls from stair k to stair k−1. The player who moves last wins the game.  Your task is to find out who wins the game when both players play optimally.  Note that if there are no possible moves at all, the second player wins.
