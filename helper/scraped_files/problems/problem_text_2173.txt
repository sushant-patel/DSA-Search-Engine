You are given an array nums that consists of positive integers.The GCD of a sequence of numbers is defined as the greatest integer that divides all the numbers in the sequence evenly.A subsequence of an array is a sequence that can be formed by removing some elements (possibly none) of the array.Return the number of different GCDs among all non-empty subsequences of nums.Â
