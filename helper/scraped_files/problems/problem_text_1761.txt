You are given an array of integers stones where stones[i] is the weight of the ith stone.We are playing a game with the stones. On each turn, we choose the heaviest two stones and smash them together. Suppose the heaviest two stones have weights x and y with x <= y. The result of this smash is:At the end of the game, there is at most one stone left.Return the smallest possible weight of the left stone. If there are no stones left, return 0.Â
