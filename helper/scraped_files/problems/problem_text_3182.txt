 CSES - Polygon Lattice Points      Given a polygon, your task is to calculate the number of lattice points inside the polygon and on its boundary. A lattice point is a point whose coordinates are integers.  The polygon consists of nn vertices (x1,y1),(x2,y2),…,(xn,yn)(x1,y1),(x2,y2),…,(xn,yn). The vertices (xi,yi) and (xi+1,yi+1) are adjacent for i=1,2,…,n−1, and the vertices (x1,y1) and (xn,yn) are also adjacent.
