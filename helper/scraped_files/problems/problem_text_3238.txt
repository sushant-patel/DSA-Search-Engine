 CSES - Letter Pair Move Game      There are 2n2n boxes in a line. Two adjacent boxes are empty, and all other boxes have a letter "A" or "B". Both letters appear in exactly n−1n−1 boxes.  Your task is to move the letters so that all letters "A" appear before any letter "B". On each turn you can choose any two adjacent boxes that have a letter and move the letters to the two adjacent empty boxes, preserving their order.  It can be proven that either there is a solution that consists of at most 10n turns or there are no solutions.
