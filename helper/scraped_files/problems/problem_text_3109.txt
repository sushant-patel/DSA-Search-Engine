 CSES - Increasing Array Queries      You are given an array that consists of nn integers. The array elements are indexed 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n.  You can modify the array using the following operation: choose an array element and increase its value by one.  Your task is to process q queries of the form: when we consider a subarray from position a to position b, what is the minimum number of operations after which the subarray is increasing?  An array is increasing if each element is greater than or equal with the previous element.
