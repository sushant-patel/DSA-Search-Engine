 CSES - Tasks and Deadlines      You have to process nn tasks. Each task has a duration and a deadline, and you will process the tasks in some order one after another. Your reward for a task is d−fd−f where d is its deadline and f is your finishing time. (The starting time is 0, and you have to process all tasks even if a task would yield negative reward.)  What is your maximum reward if you act optimally?
