The XOR total of an array is defined as the bitwise XOR of all its elements, or 0 if the array is empty.Given an array nums, return the sum of all XOR totals for every subset of nums. Note: Subsets with the same elements should be counted multiple times.An array a is a subset of an array b if a can be obtained from b by deleting some (possibly zero) elements of b.
