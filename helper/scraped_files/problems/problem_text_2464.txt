The min-product of an array is equal to the minimum value in the array multiplied by the array's sum.Given an array of integers nums, return the maximum min-product of any non-empty subarray of nums. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.Note that the min-product should be maximized before performing the modulo operation. Testcases are generated such that the maximum min-product without modulo will fit in a 64-bit signed integer.A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.Â
