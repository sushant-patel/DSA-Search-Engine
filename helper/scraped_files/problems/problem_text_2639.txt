Design an algorithm that accepts a stream of integers and retrieves the product of the last k integers of the stream.Implement the ProductOfNumbers class:The test cases are generated so that, at any time, the product of any contiguous sequence of numbers will fit into a single 32-bit integer without overflowing. Example: Constraints:
