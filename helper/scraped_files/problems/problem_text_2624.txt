There is an undirected graph with n nodes, numbered from 0 to n - 1.You are given a 0-indexed integer array scores of length n where scores[i] denotes the score of node i. You are also given a 2D integer array edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] denotes that there exists an undirected edge connecting nodes ai and bi.A node sequence is valid if it meets the following conditions:The score of a node sequence is defined as the sum of the scores of the nodes in the sequence.Return the maximum score of a valid node sequence with a length of 4. If no such sequence exists, return -1.Â
