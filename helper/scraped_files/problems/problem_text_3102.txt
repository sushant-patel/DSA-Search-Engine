 CSES - Hotel Queries      There are nn hotels on a street. For each hotel you know the number of free rooms. Your task is to assign hotel rooms for groups of tourists. All members of a group want to stay in the same hotel.  The groups will come to you one after another, and you know for each group the number of rooms it requires. You always assign a group to the first hotel having enough rooms. After this, the number of free rooms in the hotel decreases.
