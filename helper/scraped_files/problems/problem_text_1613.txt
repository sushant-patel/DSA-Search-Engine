A string is a valid parentheses string (denoted VPS) if and only if it consists of "(" and ")" characters only, and:We can similarly define the nesting depth depth(S) of any VPS S as follows:For example,  "", "()()", and "()(()())" are VPS's (with nesting depths 0, 1, and 2), and ")(" and "(()" are not VPS's. Given a VPS seq, split it into two disjoint subsequences A and B, such that A and B are VPS's (and A.length + B.length = seq.length).Now choose any such A and B such that max(depth(A), depth(B)) is the minimum possible value.Return an answer array (of length seq.length) that encodes such a choice of A and B:  answer[i] = 0 if seq[i] is part of A, else answer[i] = 1.  Note that even though multiple answers may exist, you may return any of them.
