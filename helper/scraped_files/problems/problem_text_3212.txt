 CSES - Prüfer Code      A Prüfer code of a tree of nn nodes is a sequence of n−2n−2 integers that uniquely specifies the structure of the tree.  The code is constructed as follows: As long as there are at least three nodes left, find a leaf with the smallest label, add the label of its only neighbor to the code, and remove the leaf from the tree.  Given a Prüfer code of a tree, your task is to construct the original tree.
