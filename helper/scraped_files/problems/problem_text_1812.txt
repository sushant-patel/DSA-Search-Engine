You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums consisting of 3 * n elements.You are allowed to remove any subsequence of elements of size exactly n from nums. The remaining 2 * n elements will be divided into two equal parts:The difference in sums of the two parts is denoted as sumfirst - sumsecond.Return the minimum difference possible between the sums of the two parts after the removal of n elements.Â
