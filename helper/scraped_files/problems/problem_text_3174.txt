 CSES - String Functions      We consider a string of nn characters, indexed 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n. Your task is to calculate all values of the following functions:   z(i) denotes the maximum length of a substring that begins at position i and is a prefix of the string. In addition, z(1)=0.  π(i) denotes the maximum length of a substring that ends at position i, is a prefix of the string, and whose length is at most i−1.  Note that the function z is used in the Z-algorithm, and the function π is used in the KMP algorithm.
