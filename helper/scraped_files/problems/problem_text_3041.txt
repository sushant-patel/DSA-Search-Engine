 CSES - Minimizing Coins      Consider a money system consisting of nn coins. Each coin has a positive integer value. Your task is to produce a sum of money xx using the available coins in such a way that the number of coins is minimal.  For example, if the coins are {1,5,7} and the desired sum is 11, an optimal solution is 5+5+1 which requires 3 coins.
