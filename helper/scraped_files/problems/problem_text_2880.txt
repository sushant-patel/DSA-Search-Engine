There are n uniquely-sized sticks whose lengths are integers from 1 to n. You want to arrange the sticks such that exactly k sticks are visible from the left. A stick is visible from the left if there are no longer sticks to the left of it.Given n and k, return the number of such arrangements. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
