 CSES - Moving Robots      Each square of an 8×88×8 chessboard has a robot. Each robot independently moves kk steps, and there can be many robots on the same square.  On each turn, a robot moves one step left, right, up or down, but not outside the board. It randomly chooses a direction among those where it can move.  Your task is to calculate the expected number of empty squares after k turns.
