 CSES - Permutation Inversions      Your task is to count the number of permutations of 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n that have exactly kk inversions (i.e., pairs of elements in the wrong order).  For example, when n=4 and k=3, there are 6 such permutations:  [1,4,3,2]  [2,3,4,1]  [2,4,1,3]  [3,1,4,2]  [3,2,1,4]  [4,1,2,3]
