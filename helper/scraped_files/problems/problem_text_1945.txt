You are given an even integer n​​​​​​. You initially have a permutation perm of size n​​ where perm[i] == i​ (0-indexed)​​​​.In one operation, you will create a new array arr, and for each i:You will then assign arr​​​​ to perm.Return the minimum non-zero number of operations you need to perform on perm to return the permutation to its initial value.
