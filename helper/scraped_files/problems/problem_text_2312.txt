In a linked list of size n, where n is even, the ith node (0-indexed) of the linked list is known as the twin of the (n-1-i)th node, if 0 <= i <= (n / 2) - 1.The twin sum is defined as the sum of a node and its twin.Given the head of a linked list with even length, return the maximum twin sum of the linked list.Â
