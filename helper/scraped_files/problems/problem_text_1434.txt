Given a callable function f(x, y) with a hidden formula and a value z, reverse engineer the formula and return all positive integer pairs x and y where f(x,y) == z. You may return the pairs in any order.While the exact formula is hidden, the function is monotonically increasing, i.e.:The function interface is defined like this:We will judge your solution as follows:Â
