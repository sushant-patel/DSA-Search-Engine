The hash of a 0-indexed string s of length k, given integers p and m, is computed using the following function:Where val(s[i]) represents the index of s[i] in the alphabet from val('a') = 1 to val('z') = 26.You are given a string s and the integers power, modulo, k, and hashValue. Return sub, the first substring of s of length k such that hash(sub, power, modulo) == hashValue.The test cases will be generated such that an answer always exists.A substring is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.Â
