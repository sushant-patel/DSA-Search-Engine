You are given the head of a linked list.The nodes in the linked list are sequentially assigned to non-empty groups whose lengths form the sequence of the natural numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, ...). The length of a group is the number of nodes assigned to it. In other words,Note that the length of the last group may be less than or equal to 1 + the length of the second to last group.Reverse the nodes in each group with an even length, and return the head of the modified linked list.Â
